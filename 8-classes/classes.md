## Classes
blueprint to create an object with some values and methods to represent a 'thing' 

#### Modifiers 
keywords we can use in our classes to restrict access to our methods (or vars)
by defaualt public

  - public => can be called from anywhere, any time
  - private => can only  be called by  other methods in this class
  - protected => can be called by other methods in this class  or by ther  methods in  child classes

  we mark methods as private in order to limit where we can chaange data

  #### Why do we care ?
  Interfaces and classes are going to be the primary tools we use for robust TS code
